                    <p> Current search engines are incredibly biased in favour of larger businesses, with those who have the most money being able to effectively push their competitors to the back pages where the majority (90%+) of consumers do not look. The simple fact of the matter is that unless you are on the first page of results, and increasingly even in the top three search results, the number of clients you can attract is drastically reduced. As technology improves and an increasing number of searches are conducted on phones and via voice (such as the Amazon Echo), the importance of being within the top search results is going to increase even further. This is where we can help you. We have a wealth of knowledge regarding techniques to help you achieve the search rankings that you deserve. Below you will find a contact form, briefly fill it out and we can start our journey of helping your business grow! </p>
